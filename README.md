# Flight Delay Prediction

This project is a web application that predicts flight arrival delays using a machine learning model. It is designed to help travelers, airlines, and analysts estimate the likelihood and extent of flight delays based on flight details.

---

## Example Use Case

**Suppose you are planning to travel from New York (JFK) to Los Angeles (LAX) on Delta Airlines, flight number 1234, scheduled to depart on July 15, 2025, at 10:30 AM.**  
You want to know if your flight is likely to be delayed and by how much.

With this application, you can enter:
- Origin Airport: JFK
- Destination Airport: LAX
- Airline: Delta
- Flight Number: 1234
- Date: 2025-07-15
- Scheduled Departure Time: 10:30

The app will process your input, use a trained machine learning model, and display a prediction such as:
- **Predicted Delay:** 18 minutes
- **Status:** Short Delay

---

## How It Works

1. **User Input:** Enter flight details in the web form.
2. **Prediction:** The app uses a machine learning model to estimate the delay.
3. **Result:** The predicted delay and its category (On Time, Short Delay, etc.) are shown.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (for model files)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight_delay_prediction.git
    cd flight_delay_prediction
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install flask pandas numpy joblib
    ```

3. **(If using Git LFS) Pull large files:**
    ```bash
    git lfs install
    git lfs pull
    ```

4. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python notebooks/app.py
    ```

5. **Open your browser and go to:**  
   [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Model Details

- The model is trained on historical flight data.
- It uses features like year, month, day, flight number, airline, origin, destination, distance, and scheduled departure time.
- Categorical features are encoded using label encoders.
- The output is the predicted delay in minutes, categorized for clarity.

---

## Customization

- **Web Interface:** Modify HTML templates in `notebooks/templates/`.
- **Model:** Retrain and replace `flight_delay_regressor.pkl` and update `label_encoders.pkl` as needed.
- **Data:** Update or replace CSV files in the `data/` directory for further analysis or retraining.
